This means that the model is not forced to include petrol and profit can be made of only B100. When decreasing the available area, water usage also decreases and only soybeans are grown. This causes the volume of B100 to decrease while leaving the volume of  B30 untouched. Due to the reduced production of products, the profit is decreased. Finally, when decreasing the water limit, the area used is also decreased. However, in this case, only cotton seeds are grown. This makes sense since it is the crop type that has the lowest water demand. Yet again, the volume of B30 remains untouched while B100 is reduced.\n",

    "g. Altered formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, it is investigated how the optimal solution changes if the data of the problem is altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the right-hand-sides of the constraints make a small increment/ reduction of one of the limiting resources. The optimal solution will change and therefore the profit is also affected. Hence, the shadow price of that value is this amount. The optimal solution will not change since an increase larger than a specified size in the value gives no further income.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to compute the shadow price is to construct a dual problem of our income model (which is the primal problem) and in the linear programming dual, observe that the dual problem is in accordance with the Lagrangian duality theorem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal dual solution is indeed the shadow price for the constraints. If a value on the right-hand side, $b_i$, changes, the optimal basis does not change. However, the optimal value will change exactly with the value $y^*_i$, where $y^*$ is the optimal solution of the dual problem. The formula for the reduced cost is $j^* = \\text{arg min}_{j \\subset N}{c_j - c_B^TB^{-1}}A_J$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if the necessary condition for the basis remains optimal, then $B^{-1}(b +\\Delta b)$ is non-negative, which means the values remain within the feasible set of points.\n",

    "h. A more sustainable objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple benefits of having sustainable biodiesel production. Some examples are\n",
    "\n",
    "    - a reduction in life-cycle greenhouse gases,\n",
    "    - reduction in hydrocarbon emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    " Therefore, conservation-oriented production methods (with no tillage, less water, and fertilizer consumption) with good crop selection are crucial for producing better biofuels. One reason is that using less water and more efficient ways to apply fertilizer together with no tillage and an efficient harvest reduces the net carbon emissions. Efficient ways of applying fertilizer are crucial because it reduces the outgassing of greenhouse gases that occur after fertilization. Therefore, it is necessary to take these methods into account in order to maximize the profit while paying attention to the emission of greenhouse gases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of improving the model is to add a constraint limiting the volume of greenhouse gases that are released. To do this, data containing the volume of gases released during the process of producing biodiesel. To further build upon this thought, adding a penalty fee for the types of diesel containing more petrol would improve the model even further, but with the risk of a lowered profit. The objective function will therefore be on the following form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{max } z_{new} = \\sum_{i \\in I} (R_iP_{i,2}(1-P_{i,3}) - 1B_i)-1.5M - Y(\\sum_{i \\in I}(B_i) + M),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y$ is a penalty constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning behind the new objective function is that petrol diesel and methanol contribute the most to greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, by paying an extra fee that is proportional to the volume of gases emitted, the production can be penalized for the more gases it releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, change the objective function to minimize the release of greenhouse gases and change the profit to only be a constraint."
